# GregTab

This is purely an experiment, I'm trying to build a tab program from scratch. If it ever ends up being in a working state, I will release it to whoever wants to use it. It will likely be released with no warranty or support promises.

Unless there is ever a version release, no one should ever use this to attempt to tab their tournament. Seriously. Don't. It'll be a bad idea and you'll end up really sad and I will have absolutely no sympathy. 

"But it's free..."
That's a bad reason for doing something that'll make you as upset as this will. Really, don't do it.

Right now, it won't do anything, anyway. But, some day it might and I might not update this readme to reflect that. So, it might look like it works, and it might even work until it crashes, horribly. And, really, I won't help you.
